So long as the airplane continues to fly straight and level, equal amounts of air pass through two channels around the spinning wheel of the bank-and-climb control unit.</p> <p></p> <p>Suddenly rough air causes one wing to drop. Immediately, a ring around the spinning wheel shuts air off from one of the channels. This unequalizes the air in the relay chamber of the bank-and-climb control unit, depressing the diaphragm which divides the relay chamber. When the diaphragm is depressed, a balanced oil valve opens and permits oil to flow to the hydraulic control cylinders. The pressure of this oil actuates a piston connected to the aileron cables. The piston moves forward or backward until the plane is righted.</p> <p>The flow of oil from the hydraulic cylinder is regulated by speed adjustment knobs on the automatic pilot assembly. You can vary the speed of correction by increasing or decreasing the volume of flow. You can also overpower the automatic pilot by applying increased pressure to the controls. Spring-loaded relief valves in the hydraulic cylinders permit this overpowering action if it becomes desirable.</p> <p>An automatic follow-up mechanism is part of the automatic pilot. It eases the pressure on the controls as the airplane starts to recover. When the plane is again in level flight, the action of the follow-up mechanism equalizes the pressure in the air relay chamber and cuts off the oil supply.</p> <p>You can disengage the automatic pilot quickly if necessary, by a control on the pilot's pedestal. This control is connected by a cable to a bypass valve in the hydraulic cylinder.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"equipment-and-instruments/b_25_lighting_equipment/","title":"B-25 Lighting Equipment","text":""},{"location":"equipment-and-instruments/b_25_lighting_equipment/#exterior-lighting","title":"Exterior Lighting","text":"<p>Landing Lights\u2014An 8-inch, sealed-beam landing light is in the leading edge of each outer wing panel and is operated by a switch on the pilot's control pedestal.</p> <p>Passing Light\u2014Located beside the landing light in the left outboard wing panel, it is controlled by a switch on the pilot's switch panel (not installed on late series B-25).</p> <p>Position Lights\u2014The position lights consist of a red light on the outer edge of the left wingtip, a green light on the outer edge of the right wingtip, and a white frosted light on the outboard surface of each vertical stabilizer.

That was on 25 January, 1939. Forty days later the B-25 was born!</p> <p>Daughter of a slide rule, with neither wind-tunnel tests nor prototypes to study, the performance of the B-25 was a series of figures on an engineer's drawing board.</p> <p>Yet, 19 days after Hitler marched into Poland, in September, 1939, the Army awarded the North American Aviation Company a contract for 148 Mitchell bombers, one of the largest orders written up to that time.</p> <p>In less than 2 months following a number of modifications, the mock-up was approved. Exhaustive tests by Army engineers followed, and in August, 1940, the first B-25 was test-flown and its performance found to be better than the claims its designers had made for it.</p> <p>Since that time, hundreds of changes in design have been made, but the general appearance of all models of the B-25 has not changed.</p> <p>Designed to carry a bomb load of 3500 lb. and a crew of five, it has operated efficiently with heavier bomb loads and a crew of 6. Early in the war, when it was engaged in emergency evacuation work, the B-25 carried 26 men and their baggage a distance of 700 miles. On one occasion it carried 32 men and their baggage with auxiliary and main fuel cells full.</p> <p>Red-lined at 340 mph, cruising easily at 200 mph, the Mitchell, when emergencies have arisen, has exceeded 340 mph, with no disastrous effects.</p> <p></p> <p>Its low landing speed has been a boon to flyers who have had to operate from jungle strips and airfields blasted from mountain sides.</p> <p>Combat experience led to changes in design and armament\u2014more firepower, spare fuel tanks, power-driven turrets, and larger escape hatches, which were added to meet the need for quick exit from a damaged plane.</p> <p>In April, 1942, the Mitchell made history. Under the leadership of Brigadier General Ralph Royce and Colonel John Davies, 13 B-25 aircraft set out from an unidentified base for the island of Mindanao, 2000 miles away. On this, the longest bombing expedition in the history of aerial warfare, the planes flew 2000 miles to a secret base where a store of gasoline was hidden. For 2 days they hit the Japs who were advancing on Bataan, then headed for home without loss.</p> <p>Less than a week later came the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, with 16 B-25 aircraft taking off from the deck of the aircraft carrier Hornet. It can now be told that the tail guns in the B-25 aircraft on that raid were painted broomsticks which Major General Doolittle ordered installed after learning that Jap pilots had been ordered to stay out of range of the American tail-stingers.</p> <p>During the early days of the submarine menace, B-25 aircraft were equipped with special wing bomb racks, operating successfully in the submarine hunt and again proving their versatility and capacity for modification.</p> <p>Arctic operation meant new problems in heating and defrosting for the B-25. They were overcome. Long over-water hops, with hours of precision instrument flying, brought the installation of the automatic pilot, taking the strain off our flyers. For action against the Jap navy, torpedo racks were installed. A multitude of combat problems found the B-25 ready for adaptation to meet them, its most recent and spectacular adaptation being the installation of the 75-mm. cannon in the B-25 G and B-25 H.</p> <p>The use of the B-25 as a low-altitude attack plane led to the removal of the lower turret. It was replaced by .50-cal. waist guns and a power-operated tail turret. For more effective defense, the upper turret was moved forward.</p> <p>Package guns\u2014two .50-cal mounted on each side of the fuselage and firing forward\u2014plus four .50-cal. installed in the nose above the cannon, have transformed the B-25 into a flying machine-gun company, superbly effective for strafing.</p> <p>The evolution of the Mitchell bomber does not end here.

You had to concentrate on how to fly; where your equipment was concerned, you learned to rely more and more on the enlisted men, particularly the crew chief and the engineer, for advice.</p> <p>Pilot and engineer must work closely together to supplement and fill in the blank spaces in each other's education.</p> <p>To be a qualified combat engineer, a man must know his airplane, his engines, and his armament equipment thoroughly.</p> <p>He must work closely with the copilot, checking engine operation, fuel consumption, and the operation of all equipment.</p> <p>He must be able to work with the bombardier, and know how to cock, lock, and load the bomb racks. It is up to you to see that he is familiar with these duties and, if he is hazy concerning them, to have the bombardier give him special help and instruction.</p> <p>He should have a general knowledge of radio equipment, and be able to assist in tuning transmitters and receivers.</p> <p>Your engineer should be your chief source of information about the airplane. He should know more about the equipment than any other member of the crew\u2014you included.</p> <p>You, in turn, are his source of information about flying. Bear this in mind in all your discussions with the engineer. The more complete you can make his knowledge of the reasons behind every function of the equipment, the more valuable he will be as a member of the crew. Someday his extra knowledge may save the day in an emergency.</p> <p>Generally, in emergencies, the engineer is the man to whom you turn first. Build up his pride, his confidence, his knowledge. Know him personally; check on the extent of his knowledge. Make him a man upon whom you can rely.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/the_gunners/","title":"The Gunners","text":"<p>Your gunners belong to one of two distinct categories: turret gunners and flexible gunners.</p> <p>The power turret gunners must have good coordination.</p> <p>While the flexible gunners do not require the same delicate touch as the turret gunner, they must have a fine sense of timing.</p> <p>All gunners should be familiar with the coverage area of all gun positions, and be prepared to bring the proper gun to bear on the target.</p> <p>They must be experts in aircraft identification.</p> <p>They must be thoroughly familiar with the machine guns. They should know how to maintain the guns, how to clear jams and stoppages, and how to harmonize the sights with the guns.</p> <p>During training flights, the gunners should be in their turrets, tracking with the guns even when actual firing is not practicable. Other aircraft flying in the vicinity offer excellent tracking targets, as do automobiles, houses, and other ground objects during low-altitude flights.</p> <p>Keep your gunners' interest alive at all times. Any form of competition among the gunners themselves should stimulate their interest.</p> <p>Finally, each gunner should fire the guns at each station to familiarize himself with the other positions.</p>"},{"location":"location-of-controls/bombardiers_compartment_left_side/","title":"Bombardier's Compartment-Left Side","text":"<ol> <li>Heated Clothing Electrical Outlet Control</li> <li>Bombsight Window Anti-icer Rheostat</li> <li>Ventilation Outlet Control</li> <li>Bomb Bay Door and Bomb Control Handle</li> <li>Bomb Control Panel</li> <li>Bomb Release Switch</li> <li>Selective Train Switch Interval Control</li> <li>Bombsight and Windshield Defrosting Unit</li> </ol>"},{"location":"location-of-controls/hydraulic_hand_pump_and_emergency_air_brake_control/","title":"Hydraulic Hand Pump and Emergency Air Brake Control","text":"<ol> <li>Rudder Trim</li> <li>Hydraulic Hand Pump</li> <li>Emergency Air Brake Handle</li> <li>Emergency Hydraulic Selector</li> </ol>"},{"location":"location-of-controls/navigators_compartment_forward_view/","title":"Navigator's Compartment-Forward View","text":"<ol> <li>Radio Compass Control Unit</li> <li>Main Landing Gear and Nose Gear Emergency Hydraulic Lowering Handle</li> <li>Emergency Air Brake Pressure Gage</li> <li>Hand Fire Extinguisher (CO\u2082)</li> <li>Accumulator Hydraulic Pressure Gages</li> </ol>"},{"location":"location-of-controls/pilots_compartment_general_forward_view/","title":"Pilot's Compartment - General Forward View","text":"<ol> <li>Aileron Controls</li> <li>Elevator Controls</li> <li>Rudder Controls</li> <li>Surface Control Lock</li> <li>Elevator Trim</li> <li>Throttles</li> <li>Propeller Controls</li> <li>Mixture Controls</li> <li>Parking Brake Handle</li> <li>Propeller &amp;
