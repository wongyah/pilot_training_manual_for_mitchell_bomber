# Air Induction System

![Air induction system][img_air_induction_system]

A carburetor heat control provides an alternate source of air, allowing heated air to flow from around the cylinder heads to the system.

Normally there is a baffle in the air-mixing chamber. Air entering horizontally through the cold-air intake is deflected down into the carburetor inlet. Under dusty atmospheric conditions an air filter in the air-mixing chamber replaces the baffle.
