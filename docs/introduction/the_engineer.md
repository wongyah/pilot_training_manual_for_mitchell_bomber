Size up the man who is to be your engineer. This man should know more about the airplane you are to fly than any other member of the crew. If there are deficiencies in his training you may be able to fill them in.

Think back on your own training. In many courses of instruction, you had a lot of things thrown at you from right and left. You had to concentrate on how to fly; where your equipment was concerned, you learned to rely more and more on the enlisted men, particularly the crew chief and the engineer, for advice.

Pilot and engineer must work closely together to supplement and fill in the blank spaces in each other's education.

To be a qualified combat engineer, a man must know his airplane, his engines, and his armament equipment thoroughly.

He must work closely with the copilot, checking engine operation, fuel consumption, and the operation of all equipment.

He must be able to work with the bombardier, and know how to cock, lock, and load the bomb racks. It is up to you to see that he is familiar with these duties and, if he is hazy concerning them, to have the bombardier give him special help and instruction.

He should have a general knowledge of radio equipment, and be able to assist in tuning transmitters and receivers.

Your engineer should be your chief source of information about the airplane. He should know more about the equipment than any other member of the crewâ€”you included.

You, in turn, are his source of information about flying. Bear this in mind in all your discussions with the engineer. The more complete you can make his knowledge of the reasons behind every function of the equipment, the more valuable he will be as a member of the crew. Someday his extra knowledge may save the day in an emergency.

Generally, in emergencies, the engineer is the man to whom you turn first. Build up his pride, his confidence, his knowledge. Know him personally; check on the extent of his knowledge. Make him a man upon whom you can rely.
